# EXCERCISE ONE: KNN


Data File: **Load_lending.xlsx** which is uploaded in data folder.


## Data Description:

Data contains features gathered to make a decision to whether approve / reject a loan application. 
To simplify the problem The features V1~V28 are principal components obtained by PCA. 

The class column has two values:

```
 0 -> for all applications which are declined
 1 -> If an application is approved. 
 
 ```

You need to build a KNN model which can classify the provided dataset the best. 

You may want to first save each tab in the provided dataset as a csv file prior to reading it in Pandas.


- The optimum number of K which gives you the best classification accuracy.
- Do you need to use all features in classification? or a subset? ( you need to run tests to verify that)

Once you have selected the classifier, you can apply the classifier to the data provided in evaluation tab in the Loan_lending.xlsx file and send me your prediction results.
